# template-engine
A PHP library for processing Microsoft Word templates, built on top of [PHPWord](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PHPWord)

## Why not contribute to PHPWord
Mainly speed.  I need to use this in a couple of projects fairly quickly.

I will be opening pull requests for some of this functionality against PHPWord, for now feel to use this as it is of course licenced under the LGPLv3 as a derivative work of PHPWord
